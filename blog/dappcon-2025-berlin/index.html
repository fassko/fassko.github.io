A city where <a href="https://www.berlin.de/ea/en/privacy-statement/">privacy is king</a>. Whether it is cash payments or resistance movements, it is now at the heart of conversations about digital identity and decentralization. It is no coincidence that Ethereum launched here.</p><p>Or that David Bowie found creative freedom in its streets.</p><div style="text-align: center;" class="talk-media">

</div><p>In Berlin, you are allowed to be yourself. No gaze. No judgment. Just expression.</p><p>And that is why <a href="https://dappcon.io/">DappCon</a>, a conference for decentralized app builders, felt so at home here. This city has always attracted more than just white-collar technologists. It attracts the kind of people described in¬†<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers_%26_Painters">Hackers &amp; Painters</a>: People who think differently, create something new, and push boundaries.</p><h2>What We Talked About at DappCon</h2><p>DappCon is not just another tech conference. It is a gathering of creators trying to solve deep problems with blockchain‚Äîand this year, several themes stood out.</p><h3>üíµ Stablecoins: From Speculation to Real Use</h3><p>One huge hope is that stablecoins will finally bring millions into crypto - not for speculation, but for real use. However, there is a twist here: money is currently managed by governments. Are we comfortable trusting private companies to hold and manage our digital assets instead?</p><h3>üèõÔ∏è Governments &amp; Big Tech Enter the Chat</h3><p>From Stripe integrating crypto and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/stripe-acquires-privy-crypto-wallet-infrastructure">buying blockchain companies</a> to the U.S. exploring blockchain regulation and Europe pushing <a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/esmas-activities/digital-finance-and-innovation/markets-crypto-assets-regulation-mica">MICA</a>. Institutions are arriving at the party. It is a validation and concern at the same time. If we are not careful, the decentralized web might be colonized before it becomes mainstream.</p><h3>ü§Ø UX Is Still Broken</h3><p>Let's be honest. The UX in crypto is still terrible. And I do not just mean buttons and color schemes. I mean onboarding. Trust. Understanding. People still do not know what they are signing, why they are approving, or how to stay safe. We have protocols, but we lack simple onboarding and usage.</p><h3>üïµÔ∏è Privacy and Zero-Knowledge Proofs</h3><p>We do not want everyone to know how much we spend or when we spend it. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof">Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)</a> are becoming a must. It is not just a trend. Privacy is not about hiding. It is about owning your data, your identity, and your decisions. Apple (like them or not) but they promote privacy as default.</p><h2>Was DappCon Worth It?</h2><p>Inspiring? Absolutely.</p><p>But also, are conferences broken? Talks happen. Most people are in the hallway, sipping <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club-Mate">Club Mate</a>. Almost nobody is listening (except <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalik_Buterin">Vitalik</a> talking), asking questions, challenging ideas, or digging deeper during sessions. There is an opportunity to rethink how these events¬†could¬†be.</p><h3>TL;DR</h3><p>The blockchain technology is ready.</p><p>What we need now is storytelling, education, and interfaces that people can trust. We need to get these tools into everyday life.</p><p>Berlin reminded me why I started building in this space. I am hoping to be part of what brings blockchain to the people who need it most - not just another whitepaper but in their daily lives.</p><p>Let's build something that matters.</p></div></div></section></div><footer class="footer"><p>Copyright ¬© Kristaps Grinbergs. 2025.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/fassko" target="_blank">Twitter</a>‚Ä¢<a href="/feed.rss">RSS</a>‚Ä¢<a href="/about">Contact</a></p></footer></body></html>
