title: Back from Berlin Blockchain Week: Thoughts on DappCon, Privacy, and Where Blockchain Goes Next
tags: web3, blockchain
description: DappCon in Berlin brought together builders tackling the big questions in Web3 - stablecoins, privacy, regulation, and UX. Berlin's deep-rooted values of privacy and self-expression made it the perfect setting. This post shares key insights from the conference and reflects on what still needs fixing to bring blockchain to everyday life.

Berlin has always had a certain charm. A city where [privacy is king](https://www.berlin.de/ea/en/privacy-statement/).
Whether it is cash payments or resistance movements, it is now at the heart of conversations about digital identity and decentralization.
It is no coincidence that Ethereum launched here.

Or that David Bowie found creative freedom in its streets.

In Berlin, you are allowed to be yourself. No gaze. No judgment. Just expression.

And that is why [DappCon](https://dappcon.io/), a conference for decentralized app builders, felt so at home here.
This city has always attracted more than just white-collar technologists.
It attracts the kind of people described in¬†[Hackers & Painters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers_%26_Painters): People who think differently, create something new, and push boundaries.

## What We Talked About at DappCon

DappCon is not just another tech conference.
It is a gathering of creators trying to solve deep problems with blockchain‚Äîand this year, several themes stood out.

### üíµ Stablecoins: From Speculation to Real Use

One huge hope is that stablecoins will finally bring millions into crypto - not for speculation, but for real use.
However, there is a twist here: money is currently managed by governments.
Are we comfortable trusting private companies to hold and manage our digital assets instead?

### üèõÔ∏è Governments & Big Tech Enter the Chat

From Stripe integrating crypto and [buying blockchain companies](https://cointelegraph.com/news/stripe-acquires-privy-crypto-wallet-infrastructure) to the U.S. exploring blockchain regulation and Europe pushing [MICA](https://www.esma.europa.eu/esmas-activities/digital-finance-and-innovation/markets-crypto-assets-regulation-mica). Institutions are arriving at the party. It is a validation and concern at the same time. 
If we are not careful, the decentralized web might be colonized before it becomes mainstream.

### ü§Ø UX Is Still Broken

Let's be honest.
The UX in crypto is still terrible.
And I do not just mean buttons and color schemes.
I mean onboarding.
Trust.
Understanding.
People still do not know what they are signing, why they are approving, or how to stay safe. We have protocols, but we lack simple onboarding and usage.


### üïµÔ∏è Privacy and Zero-Knowledge Proofs

We do not want everyone to know how much we spend or when we spend it.
[Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof) are becoming a must.
It is not just a trend.
Privacy is not about hiding. It is about owning your data, your identity, and your decisions.
Apple (like them or not) but they promote privacy as default.

## Was DappCon Worth It?

Inspiring?
Absolutely.

But also, are conferences broken?
Talks happen. Most people are in the hallway, sipping [Club Mate](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club-Mate).
Almost nobody is listening (except [Vitalik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalik_Buterin) talking), asking questions, challenging ideas, or digging deeper during sessions.
There is an opportunity to rethink how these events¬†could¬†be.

### TL;DR

The blockchain technology is ready.

What we need now is storytelling, education, and interfaces that people can trust.
We need to get these tools into everyday life.

Berlin reminded me why I started building in this space.
I am hoping to be part of what brings blockchain to the people who need it most - not just another whitepaper but in their daily lives.

Let's build something that matters.
